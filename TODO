Overview: what does the app need to do

-Determine user's location, match them to appropriate board
  -Get location

-Allow users to make a text post, and choose location on board to post
  -Eventually upgrade to allow images
  -Give user ability to write text
  -Turn text into image

-Make database of boards
  -Start with one global board, work from there
  -Store boards as images
  -Make a database that can store an image
  -Access the database to get that image
  -I guess first just make the board just a text wall and deal with images later
  -so first make an app that lets users access a database and add to the text stored there



Some psuedo code:

//show the board, allow user to make a new post
appMain() {
  showBoard();
  if(newPostButton.clicked()) {
    makeNewPost();
  }
}


//give the user a keyboard, allow them to type a post to send to database
makeNewPost() {
  makeTextBox();
  makePostButton(); // sends text to database
  return;
}


//send text to database, put in queue of updates, append text to text wall
uploadPost(string text) {
  database.write(text);
}


//take text from database, print to board
showBoard() {
  string text = database.read(boardText);
  print(text);
}
